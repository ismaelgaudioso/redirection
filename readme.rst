What is Redirector
###################

"Redirector" is a web application that lets you connect to web services on a server with dynamic addressing. The web server communicates with regularly achieve API redirector and tells its public IP. We can then access the web services configured independently of the server IP.
We want to set up as many redirects as indicating port and whether it is a secure connection (SSL).

Redirector generally use web services to reach attached servers through a dynamic public IP. Redirector running on another web server, and securely stores the current public IP from where we want to go.


*******************
Release Information
*******************

This repository contains the first release of Redirector. You can create as many redirections as you like to a single server. To enhance access security, it includes a users system Redirector.
It also has a public API to update the IP. This API is securized with API Key generated by the Redirector own.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

You need a hosting service with this options.

- PHP version 5.4 or newer is recommended.
- MySQL  

It should work on 5.2.4 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

This public hosting allows you the server with dynamic IP reach. You can use hosting service like hostgator or hostinger (with free account), or IaaS like AWS, Heroku, Appfog...

************
Installation
************

You may install Redirector in the public hosting first. 

To start redirector should rename the ".htaccess-example" root file ".htaccess" and "database_example.php" a "database.php" and complete the information with access to the database.

Database.sql run file in the database to generate the entire structure with MySQL tables.

The default user is admin@admin.com and password "Password".

At that point you can now log on to Redirector. We recommend first perform these actions:
- Create new user password or change the default one.
- Update IP in menu "Settings"> "General"
- Create redirects in the same menu.
- Create access API Key in menu "Clients".

With Key generated by Redirector, You can create a scheduled task (ie. crontab) on the web server to be achieved and that has a dynamic IP public. You use curl to call the API with the following URL:

http://yourdomain.com/api/updateIp?token=api_key_token_generated

In this example, we assume that Redirector is installed in the root directory of yourdomain.
